Zudus begins betrayed in level zero. Was he betrayed by others or mearly by himself by self sabatage maybe caused by his self-rage brought on by his strong delusion that the damage from his foolish mistakes will leave him with no hope. Maybe he just has unrealistic pressure that he puts on himself, misunderstanding his undetermined future.

What should I do next in my json?
