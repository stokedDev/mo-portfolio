            <p>JavaScript was made for the user-facing part of a website. 
              It was meant to work with HTML and CSS as their lightweight beginner-friendly programming language.
              JS was meant to be read by the browser engine exclusively.
              It was meant to be like Java but easier and simpler.
              JS can be written in a script element in an HTML file, or in a file of its own that is linked to in the HTML file.
              <code class="script-element-code-snippet">&lt;script&gt;<br>
                 /* <br>JS can be written in a script element which consists of an opening and closing script tag. <br>
                 */&lt;/script&gt;</code>

            <p>JavaScript is one of the main programming languages used for front end web development.</p>
            <p>JS(or JavaScript) is also one of the main programming languages used for backend web development.</p>

            <p>There are many ways to learn JS but here are some of my recommendations.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Search on a good search engine (
                  <a href="https://www.google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                    google, for example
                  </a>
                  ) to find the JavaScript information you need.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a>
                 will guide you through a curriculum for free.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                  Mozilla Developer Network
                </a> 
                has exhaustive ( or near-exhaustive ) technical documentation that is likely to be very helpful while learning.
              </li>
              <li>
                One of my favorite ways to learn JS is from the

                  Net Ninja on YouTube
                </a>.

                  Scrimba

            </li>
              <li>
                Learning JavaScript online is likely to be successful if what is learned is put into practice.

            <code>var variable = 'A variable declared with the old "var"';</code>

              <br>
              <code>const VARIABLE_3 = 'A variable declared with const(short for constant)';</code>
            <p>In 2015 two important new JavaScript keywords were introduced: let and const.</p>
            <p>Variables: declared with the "const" and "let" keywords may have global scope, function scope, or block scope; declared with the "const" keyword cannot be modified unless they are arrays; declared with the "let" keyword can be modified; declared with the "var" keyword can be modified, can have global scope, can have function scope, but cannot have block scope. ( A variable with block scope cannot be accessed outside of a loop, an if statement, nor the block scope that it is declared in. )</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Variables help make things faster and easier by allowing you to store functions, arrays, objects, calculations, values, and more.</li>
              <li>
                Variables allow you to reuse one or more lines of code without having to repeat yourself.
              </li>
              <li>
                Descriptive variable naming and efficient use of variables is one of the most key parts of making a JS codebase maintainable.

              <p>
                A conditional is how JavaScript or any other programming language can use boolean logic to return a result.
              </p> 
                <p>
                  Boolean logic refers to what determines a value to be true or false.
                </p> 
            <p>The following are examples of JS conditionals: if, else if, else, switch statements, ternaries.</p>
            <p>JS conditionals can be used to dynamically solve problems by using boolean logic to return a result.</p>

              <p>
                The DOM (Document Object Model), allows a JS file to interact with any HTML file that links to the JS file path.
              </p>
            <p>When creating or getting elements to use in your JS, always remember to type the keyword "document" first.</p>
              <p>To adjust the style of an element, code like this:<code> HEADER.style.fontSize = '1.2rem'</code></p>
            <ul>
              <li>All style properties in JS are the same as CSS but they are camel cased instead of using dashes.</li>
              <li>All style values in JS are declared inside quotes.</li>
