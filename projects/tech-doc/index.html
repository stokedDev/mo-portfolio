            <p>JavaScript was made for the user-facing part of a website. 
              It was meant to work with HTML and CSS as their lightweight beginner-friendly programming language.
              It was meant to be like Java but easier and simpler.
              Unlike Java though, JS (meaning JavaScript) was meant to be read by the browser engine exclusively.
              JS can be written in a script element in an HTML file, or in a file of its own that is linked to in the HTML file.

              <h2 class="section-h2 section-3-title">Variables</h2>
            </header>
            <div class="code-snippet-group">
            <code>var variable = 'A variable declared with the old "var"';</code>
              <code>let variable2 = 'A variable declared with the mutable "let"';</code>
              <code>const VARIABLE_3 = 'A variable declared with const(short for constant)';</code>
              </div>
            <p>In 2015 two important new JavaScript keywords were introduced: let and const.
            Variables: declared with the "const" and "let" keywords may have global scope,
function scope, or block scope; declared with the "const" keyword cannot be modified unless they are arrays; 
declared with the "let" keyword can be modified; 
declared with the "var" keyword can be modified, can have global scope, can have function scope, but cannot have block scope. 
(A variable with block scope cannot be accessed outside of a loop, an if statement, nor the block scope that it is declared in.)</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Variables are initialized with a custom name and usually assigned data (data examples: functions, arrays, objects, calculations, values, or others.)</li>
              <li>
                Variables allow coders to reuse one or more lines of code without having to repeat themselves.
              </li>
              <li>
                If it weren't for variables, JS would take much longer to write and would slow down webpages 
considerably (as there would be much more code to read by the browser engine).
              </li>
              <li>
                Descriptive variable naming and efficient use of variables is one of the most key parts of making a JS codebase maintainable.

              <p>
                 The following explains the checkTirePressure function code below. 
                 PSI means pounds per square inch and is used to measure air pressure.
                 The following function code has two parameters
                 (a tires current PSI and its recommended minimum PSI).
                 The checkTirePressure function has room to improve,
                 but it demonstrates use of conditionals (an "if else statement chain" and a "ternary operator").
                 The function body in the code below has an "if else statement chain" 
                 with a ternary operator in a template literal in the "else" body. 
                 A template literal is a dollar symbol followed by an expression nested in a pair of curly braces.
                 A template literal is used to allow an expression in a back tick string.
                 The back tick is usually located on the top left of a keyboard under the "esc" key.
                 A back tick string is meant for template literal use.
                 Conditionals and strings are two different topics of JS,
                 but strings (and/or any other data type) are often used with conditionals.

                  and 60 as tireRecommendedMinimumPSI,
                  so it will return the following string,
                  'Tire pressure is above the recommended minimum PSI.'
              </p>
              <code>

              <p> This second function call just below
              has 59 as tirePSI and 60 as tireRecommendedMinimumPSI,
              so it will return the following string,
              'Tire pressure is less than recommended PSI.'.

                </code>
             
              <p> An example of a switch conditional statement is in a function named describeStr below.
                The function describeStr is meant to receive a string(a string is text in double-quotes, single-quotes, or back-ticks)
                as an argument and return a description of the string.
                The describeStr function body has a switch statement that takes an expression str, a string (switch statements can of course take expressions other than strings).
                The switch statement has a series of clauses that can execute their own statement if a case is matched.
                The default clause executes when none of the case clauses match the expression.
                The function describeStr returns a description of str when a case clause matches str, otherwise an apology for not having a description for str is returned.

                the HEADER named constant via a property called textContent.
                There must be an h1 HTML element in the HTML body for the code just below to work.
