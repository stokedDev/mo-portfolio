            <p>JavaScript was made for the user-facing part of a website. 
              It was meant to work with HTML and CSS as their lightweight beginner-friendly programming language.
              JS ( meaning JavaScript ) was meant to be read by the browser engine exclusively.
              It was meant to be like Java but easier and simpler.
              JS can be written in a script element in an HTML file, or in a file of its own that is linked to in the HTML file.
            </p>
              <code class="script-element-code-snippet"><br>&lt;script&gt;<br>

                 */<br>&lt;/script&gt;</code>
            <p>JavaScript is one of the main programming languages used for front end web development.</p>
            <p>JS is also one of the main programming languages used for backend web development.</p>

                JS can be used on the front end to dynamically change a client-facing web page in response to user input.

                </a> 
                has exhaustive ( or near-exhaustive ) technical documentation that is likely to be very helpful while learning.
              </li>
              <li>
                One of my favorite ways to learn JS is from the

            <section class="main-section carousel-item" class="variables">
            <header>
              <h2 class="section-header-3">Variables</h2>
            </header>
            <code>var variable = 'A variable declared with the old "var"';</code>
              <br>
              <code>let variable2 = 'A variable declared with the mutable "let"';</code>
              <br>
              <code>const VARIABLE_3 = 'A variable declared with const(short for constant)';</code>
            <p>In 2015 two important new JavaScript keywords were introduced: let and const.</p>
            <p>Variables: declared with the "const" and "let" keywords may have global scope,
function scope, or block scope; declared with the "const" keyword cannot be modified unless they are arrays; 
declared with the "let" keyword can be modified; 
declared with the "var" keyword can be modified, can have global scope, can have function scope, but cannot have block scope. 
( A variable with block scope cannot be accessed outside of a loop, an if statement, nor the block scope that it is declared in. )</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Variables are initialized with a custom name and usually assigned data ( data examples: functions, arrays, objects, calculations, values, or others. )</li>
              <li>
                Variables allow coders to reuse one or more lines of code without having to repeat themselves.
              </li>
              <li>
                If it weren't for variables, JS would take much longer to write and would slow down webpages 
considerably ( as there would be much more code to read by the browser engine ).
              </li>
              <li>
                Descriptive variable naming and efficient use of variables is one of the most key parts of making a JS codebase maintainable.

                 The following explains the checkTirePressure function code below.<br>
                 PSI means pounds per square inch. <br>
                 The following function code has two parameters<br> 
                 ( a tires current PSI and its recommended minimum PSI ). <br>
                 The checkTirePressure function has room to improve
                 but it demonstrates use of conditionals <br>(an "if else statement chain" and a "ternary operator").<br>
                 The function body in the code below has an "if else statement chain" 
                 with a ternary operator in a template literal. 
                 A template literal is a dollar symbol followed by an expression nested in a pair of curly brackets.
                 A template literal allows for an expression in a back tick string.
                 </p>
            <code>
              function checkTirePressure(tirePSI, tireRecommendedMinimumPSI){
                <div class="code-snippet-indent">
              if (tirePSI < tireRecommendedMinimumPSI) {

                <div class="code-snippet-indent">
              return `Tire pressure is ${tirePSI === tireRecommendedMinimumPSI?<br>  
              'equal to': 'above'} the recommended minimum PSI.`;
              </div>

              </div>

              </code>
              <p> The function call just below
                  has 61 as tirePSI 
                  and 60 as tireRecommendedMinimumPSI,
                  so it will return the following string,
                  'Tire pressure is above the recommended minimum PSI.'
              </p>
              <code>
              checkTirePressure(61, 60);<br>
            </code>
              <p> This second function call just below
              has 59 as tirePSI and 60 as tireRecommendedMinimumPSI,
              so it will return the following string,
              'Tire pressure is less than recommended PSI.'.
                </p>
                <br>
                <code>
                  checkTirePressure(59, 60);
                </code>

              <!-- write example for switch -->
              <p> An example of a switch conditional statement is below. 
              </p>
              <p>
                A conditional is how JavaScript or any other programming language can use boolean logic to return a result.
              </p> 
                <p>
                  Boolean logic refers to what determines a value to be true or false.
                </p> 
            <p>JS conditionals can be used to dynamically solve problems by using boolean logic to return a result.</p>

                  The following code is related to the code above.
                  The following code assigns '1.2rem'

                    to the style object of the 
                    DOM ( Document Object Model ) const variable named HEADER.
              </p>
              <p>To adjust the style of an element, code like this:</p>
