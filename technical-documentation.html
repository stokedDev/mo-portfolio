        This is just meant to be a brief preview of my coding ability. I actually know a lot more about JS but I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel when MDN has JS documentation covered. I hope you understand. Thank you for reading.

            </header>
            <p>There are many ways to learn JS but here are a few ways.</p>
            <p>freeCodeCamp.org is a great way to get started.</p>
            <p>Mozilla Developer Network will be very helpful while learning.</p>
            <p>Youtube tutorials can be a tedious way to learn, I recommend using Scrimba, a website with interactive coding tutorials.</p>
          </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Variables" class="variables">
            <header>
              <h2>Variables</h2>
            </header>
            <code>var variable = 'A variable declared with the old "var"';</code>
              <br>
              <code>let variable2 = 'A variable declared with the mutable "let"';</code>
              <br>
              <code>const VARIABLE_3 = 'A variable declared with const(short for constant)';</code>
            <p>In 2015 two important new JavaScript keywords were introduced: let and const.</p>
            <p>Let your go-to be "const"(as it will help you not make bugs), use "let" if you need to(as it can be mutated), and use var only if you need to access and/or modify your variable from anywhere(no matter whether it's in a function or not). Try not to use var because you should be able to accomplish everything you need with "let" and "const".</p>
              <p>Const and let variables can be accessed globally like var if they are created on a line alone without being in a function. But, if they are created within a function, they won't exist outside. This means that you can declare two const variables with the same name just as long as they are in separate scopes. They will both render and can have the same or differing values.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Variables help make things faster and easier by allowing you to store functions, arrays, objects, calculations, values, and more.</li>
              
            </ul>

            <section class="main-section" id="Conditionals">

              <h2>Conditionals</h2>

            <code>if (height >= 4) {
              <br>
              console.log('You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster.');
              <br>
              }
            </code>
              <p>
                A conditional is how javascript or any other programming language can use boolean logic to get an answer based on that boolean logic. Boolean logic refers to what determines a value to be true or false.
                <br>
                <br>
              </p>
            <p>The following are examples of JS conditionals: if, else if, else, switch statements, ternaries.</p>
            <p>These can be used to dynamically solve problems based on possible factors.</p>

            </header>
              <code class="code">const HEADER = document<span class="toggle-block">.getElementsByTagName('h1')[0]</span></code>
            <p>When creating or getting elements to use in your JS, always remember to type the keyword "document" first.</p>
              <p>To adjust the style of an element, code like this:<code> HEADER.style.fontSize = '1.2rem'</code></p>
            <ul>
              <li>All style properties in JS are the same as CSS but they are camel cased instead of using dashes.</li>
              <li>All style values in JS are declared inside quotes.</li>
