## Introduction
My website https://www.stokeddev.com , which this repository belongs to, is a result of my 1300+ hours studying and practicing front end engineering from the beginning of my developer journey in September of 2020. I thoughtfully wrote every line of frontend code that makes up this website with HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Projects
Documentation Page, Product Landing Page, My Survey Form, My Tribute Page, "Fun Money" calculator, My Blackjack Game, and My Dice Game were all designed by me to be fully responsive to all devices. All hamburger icon mobile menu popup toggle HTML, CSS, and JS that appears in some of my projects is my own original code that I came up with.

### 1. My First Surf Game
https://stokeddev.com/SurfGame/index.html

On my stokeddev website in my projects grid, this project only appears on screens 1024px wide or wider.
This is because it's controls currently require the user to have a keyboard. To move the character, the keyboard directional keys must be used.
I took some concepts I learned from building my HTML5 snake game and adapted them to make this project.
Creating a surfing game was one of my motivations to learn to code so I'm happy to have finally done it.
I built this using HTML, CSS, and JS.

### 2. fCC JS Cert Repo
https://github.com/stokedDev/freeCodeCampJSProjects

By remembering what I learned from the freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures curriculum and using resources from across the web I completed these challenges which allowed me to earn my certification.

### 3. Documentation Page
https://stokeddev.com/tech-doc/technical-documentation.html

This is based on one of the freeCodeCamp projects that I needed to complete in order to get my Responsive Web Design certification. 
This is my JavaScript Documentation Page that I created with HTML, CSS, and JS. Instead of just copying and pasting someone elses documentation and giving them credit for it, like freeCodeCamp themselves did in their example for this finished project, I took a different route. I used my current knowledge and understanding of JS to create my own text to work with so that I could write HTML, CSS, and JS to make a beautiful webpage to present a sample of my frontend engineering skills.

### 4. Product Landing Page
https://stokeddev.com/product-landing/product-landing.html

This is based on one of the freeCodeCamp projects that I built in order to get my Responsive Web Design certification.
I built it with HTML, CSS, and JS. It is for a company I made up that manuafactures wave pools for surfing.

### 5. My Survey Form
https://stokeddev.com/survey0/survey.html

This is based on one of the freeCodeCamp projects that I built in order to get my Responsive Web Design certification.
I built it with HTML, CSS, and JS. It taught me the advanced HTML skill of building forms for user input with validation.
I might turn this into something like a story generator by writing JS to turn the user input into a short story so that the user is rewarded for filling out the form. I feel confident I can do this but finding the time when I have other things to learn is going to be a challenge.

### 6. My Tribute Page
https://stokeddev.com/tribute.html

This is based on one of the freeCodeCamp projects that I built in order to get my Responsive Web Design certification.
I built it with HTML and CSS. It features an HTML table and a color transition background.

### 7. "Fun Money" Calculator
https://stokeddev.com/funmoneyapp/index.html

This is one of my first ever frontend projects which I originally set up hosting for with firebase and my domain at the time funmoney.app .
After constantly and tediously using a regular calculator to see how I felt about how much I would have left over from different salaries, I decided to put my coding skills to work. So with this project I automated and simplified the calculation process for others and myself. This project is an example of me taking HTML form data and processing it with JS to return a result to the user which solves their problem. The freeCodeCamp community was really helpful for me as I reached out to them for guidance during this project. One way they helped was suggesting a way to convert the processed data to US dollar format. I built this with HTML, CSS, and JS. 

### 8. My Blackjack Game
https://stokeddev.com/blackjack-game/index.html

I started this project while working my way through the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path as it was an assignment.
I got good practice dynamically controlling HTML with JS.
To start the game, click the "(re)start" button and if you don't win or lose right away keep grabbing new cards with the "new card" button until you win or lose. Then click "(re)start" to restart the game if you want.  I wrote all the HTML, CSS, and JS for this game thoughtfully line by line.

### 9. My Dice Game
https://stokeddev.com/dice-game/index.html

I started this project while working my way through the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path as it was an assignment.
I got good practice dynamically controlling HTML with JS and CSS. I programmed CSS animations to happen in response to things like clicks and when someone wins. I wrote all the HTML, CSS, and JS for this game thoughtfully line by line. I chose all the styles and colors myself.

### 10. My Snake Game
https://stokeddev.com/snake-game/index.html

I started this project while working my way through the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path as it was an assignment.
I got good practice dynamically controlling HTML with JS and CSS. I wrote all the HTML, CSS, and JS for this game thoughtfully line by line. I chose all the styles and colors myself. This game is only visible in the projects section for viewport width of 1020px.
