# mo-portfolio
My frontend web developer portfolio which I built at my own pace while learning from many free and affordable resources online.

My website https://www.stokeddev.com , which this repository belongs to is of the highest importance to me. From the beginning of my developer journey in September of 2020, I have spent 1,100+ hours studying and practicing front end engineering.

Here are projects that took me less than a month total to build including the entire stokeddev website.

I built a snake game that I just thought of adding. Since in my opinion no snake game plays well on touch screen devices (from my experience playing snake) because the users fingers obstruct the screen. I'll just add a media query to toggle whether the project CSS3 grid item(my snake game thumbnail) is visible or not depending on screen width or I could target actual devices but screen width does the job well enough.

Note on July 7 @ 4:29pm ( I just started working on my new project, my async js app. )

Note on July 9 @ 3:45am ( I got distracted by learning about things related to my async js app instead of making the progress I originally intended which was to start the json file for it right away and push that to github. )

Note on July 9 @ 3:53am ( I'm going to get back to coding. )

Note on July 9 @ 4:25am ( I just realized that I can use local storage to make a CRUD app, now I'm heading in that direction. )
