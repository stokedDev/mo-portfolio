          This webpage is just meant to be a sample of my frontend development ability. I actually know a lot more than this about JS but I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel when <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MDN</a> has JS documentation covered. Thank you for reading.❤️

            <p>There are many ways to learn JS but here are some of my recommendations.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Search on a good search engine (
                  <a href="https://www.google.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
                    google, for example
                  </a>
                  ) to find the JavaScript information you need.
              </li>

                <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a>

                will be very helpful while learning.
              </li>

                One of my favorite ways to learn JS is from the

            <section class="main-section carousel-item" class="variables">
            <header>
              <h2 class="section-header-3">Variables</h2>
            </header>
            <code>var variable = 'A variable declared with the old "var"';</code>
              <br>
              <code>let variable2 = 'A variable declared with the mutable "let"';</code>
              <br>
              <code>const VARIABLE_3 = 'A variable declared with const(short for constant)';</code>
            <p>In 2015 two important new JavaScript keywords were introduced: let and const.</p>
            <p>Let your go-to be "const"(as it will help you not make bugs), use "let" if you need to(as it can be mutated), and use "var" only if you need to access and/or modify your variable from anywhere(no matter whether it's in a function or not). Try not to use var because you should be able to accomplish everything you need with "let" and "const".</p>
              <p>Const and let variables can be accessed globally like var if they are created on a line alone without being in a function. But, if they are created within a function, they won't exist outside. This means that you can declare two const variables with the same name just as long as they are in separate scopes. They will both render and can have the same or differing values.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Variables help make things faster and easier by allowing you to store functions, arrays, objects, calculations, values, and more.</li>
              <li>
                Variables allow you to reuse one or more lines of code without having to repeat yourself.
              </li>
              <li>
                Proper use of variables is one of the most key parts of making your JS codebase maintainable.

            <code>if (height >= 4) {
              <br>
              console.log('You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster.');

            </code>
              <p>
                A conditional is how JavaScript or any other programming language can use boolean logic to return a result.
              </p> 
                <p>
                  Boolean logic refers to what determines a value to be true or false.
                </p> 
            <p>The following are examples of JS conditionals: if, else if, else, switch statements, ternaries.</p>
            <p>JS conditionals can be used to dynamically solve problems by using boolean logic to return a result.</p>

              <p>
                The DOM (Document Object Model), allows a JS file to interact with any HTML file that links to the JS file path.
              </p>
            <p>When creating or getting elements to use in your JS, always remember to type the keyword "document" first.</p>
              <p>To adjust the style of an element, code like this:<code> HEADER.style.fontSize = '1.2rem'</code></p>
            <ul>
              <li>All style properties in JS are the same as CSS but they are camel cased instead of using dashes.</li>
              <li>All style values in JS are declared inside quotes.</li>
